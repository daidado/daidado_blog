There's a fire starting in my heart reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark. Finally, I can see you crystal clear. Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your ship bare. See how I'll leave with every piece of you. Don't underestimate the things that I will do. There's a fire starting in my heart reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark.

The scars of your love remind me of us. They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless. I can't help feeling We could have had it all rolling in the deep. You had my heart inside of your hand and you played it to the beat.

You're gonna wish you never had met me. Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep. You're gonna wish you never had met me. Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep. 

Baby, I have no story to be told but I've heard one on you now I'm gonna make your head burn. Think of me in the depths of your despair. Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared.

The scars of your love remind me of us. They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless. I can't help feeling We could have had it all rolling in the deep. You had my heart inside of your hand and you played it to the beat.

You're gonna wish you never had met me. Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep. You're gonna wish you never had met me. Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep. 

Could have had it all. Rolling in the deep. You had my heart inside of your hand but you played it with a beating.

Throw your soul through every open door. Count your blessings to find what you look for. Turn my sorrow into treasured gold. You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow.

We could have had it all.
We could have had it all.
It all, it all, it all.
We could have had it all rolling in the deep. You had my heart inside of your hand. And you played it to the beat.

You're gonna wish you never had met me. Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep. You're gonna wish you never had met me. Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep. 

We could have had it all rolling in the deep. You had my heart inside of your hand but you played it.
You played it.
You played it to the beat.
