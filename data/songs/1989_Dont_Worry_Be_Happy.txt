Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note-for-note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry, you make it double
Don't worry, be happy Don't worry, be happy now
Oh Don't worry
Wooh Be happy
Wooh Don't worry, be happy
Oooh Don't worry
Wooh Be happy
Wooh Don't worry, be happy
Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry, (ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha) be happy (look at me, I'm happy)
Ooh Don't worry
Ooh Be happy
Ooh (Here, I'll give you my phone number. When you're
Worried, call me. I'll make you happy.)
Ooh Don't worry
Woh Be happy
Woh
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you're worried, your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy Don't worry, be happy now
Ooh Don't worry
Ooh Be happy
Wooh Don't worry, be happy
Oooh Don't worry
Wooh Be happy
Wooh Don't worry, be happy
Now there, is this song I wrote
I hope you learned it note-for-note, like good little children
Don't worry, be happy
A-listen to a-what I say
In your life, expect some trouble
When you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy, be happy now
Oooh Don't worry
Ooh Be happy
Ooh Don't worry, be happy
Ooh Don't worry
Wooh Be happy
Wooh Don't worry, be happy
Oooh Don't worry, don't worry
Ooh Don't do it, be happy
Ooh Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like
This
Oooh Don't worry
Oooh It will soon pass, whatever it
Is
Oooh Don't worry, be happy
Oooh I'm not worried
Oooh I'm happy
Oooh
