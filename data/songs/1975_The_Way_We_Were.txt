Memories
Light the corners of my mind,
Misty watercolor memories,
Of the way we were.
Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind,
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were.
Can it be
That it was all so simple then,
Or has time rewritten ev'ry line?
If we had the chance
To do it all again,
Tell me would we? Could we?
Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget.
So it's the laughter
We will remember,
Whenever we remember
The way we were.
Every day was like
A gift of flowers,
Ribbon-wrapped
And waiting to be seen.
Eagerly we opened all the hours
Then what happened happened.
Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget.
So it's the laughter
We will remember,
Whenever we remember
The way we were.
The way we were.
