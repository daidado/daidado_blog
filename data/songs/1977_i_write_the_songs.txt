I've been alive foreverAnd I wrote the very first songI put the words and the melodies together
I am musicAnd I write the songsI write the songs that make the whole world singI write the songs of love and special thingsI write the songs that make the young girls cryI write the songs, I write the songsMy home lies deep within youAnd I've got my own place in your soulNow when I look out through your eyesI'm young again, even tho' I'm very oldI write the songs that make the whole world singI write the songs of love and special thingsI write the songs that make the young girls cryI write the songs, I write the songsOh, my music makes you dance and gives you spirit to take a chanceAnd I wrote some rock 'n roll so you can moveMusic fills your heart, well that's a real fine place to startIt's from me, it's for youIt's from you, it's for meIt's a worldwide symphonyI write the songs that make the whole world singI write the songs of love and special thingsI write the songs that make the young girls cryI write the songs, I write the songsI write the songs that make the whole world singI write the songs of love and special thingsI write the songs that make the young girls cryI write the songs, I write the songsI am music and I write the songs
