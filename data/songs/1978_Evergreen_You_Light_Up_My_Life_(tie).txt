Love soft as an easy chair
Love fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you
Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two
You and I will
make each night the first
Everyday a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us
'Cause we have the brightest love
Two lights that shine as one Morning glory and midnight sun
Time... we've learned to sail above
Time... won't change the meaning of one love
Ageless and ever evergreenâ€¦


So many nights I'd sit by my window
Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark but now you've come along
And you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song
Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turnin' for home
Finally a chance to say &quot;Hey, I love you&quot;
Never again to be all alone
And you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song
'Cause you, you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song
It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you
You light up my life
