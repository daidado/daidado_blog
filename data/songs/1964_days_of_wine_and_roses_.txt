The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play
Through a meadow land toward a closing door
A door marked &quot;nevermore&quot; that wasn't there before
The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you
just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you-oo-oo
