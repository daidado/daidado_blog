If I can reach the stars. Pull one down for you. Shine it on my heart so you could see the truth that this love I have inside is everything it seems. But for now I find it's only in my dreams and I can change the world. I will be the sunlight in your universe. You would think my love was really something good.

Baby if I could change the world and if I could be king even for a day I'd take you as my queen. I'd have it no other way. And our love would rule This kingdom we had made. Till then I'd be a fool wishing for the day. That I can change the world I would be the sunlight in your universe. You would think my love was really something good.

Baby if I could change the world.
Baby if I could change the world.

I could change the world. I would be the sunlight in your universe. You would think my love was really something good.

Baby if I could change the world.
Baby if I could change the world.
Baby if I could change the world.
