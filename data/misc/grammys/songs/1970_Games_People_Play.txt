Oh the games people play now. Every night and every day now. Never meaning what they say now. Never saying what they mean. And they wile away the hours in their ivory towers 'till they're covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine.

Talking 'bout you and me and the games people play. Oh we make one another cry.Break a heart then we say goodbye. Cross our hearts and we hope to die that the other was to blame. Neither one will give in, so we gaze at our eight by ten thinking 'bout the things that might have been. It's a dirty rotten shame.

People walking up to you singing glory hallelulia. And they're tryin to sock it to you In the name of the Lord. They're gonna teach you how to meditate. Read your horoscope. Cheat your fate. And further more to hell with hate.

Come on and get on board. Look around tell me what you see. What's happening to you and me? God grant me the serenity to remember who I am 'cause you've given up your sanity for your pride and your vanity. Turns your back on humanity and you don't give a da-.
