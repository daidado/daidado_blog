I keep on fallin' in and out of love with you. Sometimes I love ya, sometimes you make me blue. Sometimes I feel good. Other times I feel used. Lovin' you darlin' makes me so confused.

I keep on fallin' in and out of love with you. I never loved someone the way that I love you. 

Oh, oh, I never felt this way. How do you give me so much pleasure and cause me so much pain? Just when I think I've taken more than would a fool I start fallin' back in love with you.

I keep on fallin' in and out of love with you. I never loved someone the way that I love you. Oh, baby I'm fallin', I'm fallin'. Fall.

I keep on fallin' in and out of love with you. I never loved someone the way that I love you. I'm fallin' In and out of love with you. I never loved someone the way that I love you. I'm fallin' in and out of love with you. I never loved someone the way that I love you. What?
