Back when I was a child before life removed all the innocence my father would lift me high and dance with my mother and me and then spin me around 'till I fell asleep. Then up the stairs he would carry me and I knew for sure I was loved. If I could get another chance, another walk, another dance with him, I'd play a song that would never ever end.

How I'd love love love  to dance with my father again. When I and my mother would disagree to get my way I would run from her to him. He'd make me laugh just to comfort me, yeah, yeah, then finally make me do just what my mama said. Later that night when I was asleep he left a dollar under my sheet. Never dreamed that he would be gone from me. If I could steal one final glance, one final step, one final dance with him I'd play a song that would never ever end.

Cause I'd love love love to dance with my father again. Sometimes I'd listen outside her door and I'd hear how mama would cry for him. I'd pray for her even more than me. I'd pray for her even more than me. I know I'm praying for much too much but could you send her the only man she loved? I know you don't do it usually but Dear Lord she's dying to dance with my father again. Every night I fall asleep and this is all I ever dream
