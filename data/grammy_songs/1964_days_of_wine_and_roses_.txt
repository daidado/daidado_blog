The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play through a meadow land toward a closing door. A door marked "nevermore" that wasn't there before. The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories of the golden smile that introduced me to the days of wine and roses and you. Just a passing breeze filled with memories of the golden smile that introduced me to the days of wine and roses and you.
