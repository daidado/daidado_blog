I can show you the world. Shining, shimmering splendid. Tell me, princess, now when did you last let your heart decide! I can open your eyes, take you wonder by wonder over sideways and under on a magic carpet ride.

A whole new world. A new fantastic point of view. No one to tell us no or where to go or say we're only dreaming.

A whole new world. A dazzling place I never knew. But when I'm way up here it's crystal clear that now I'm in a whole new world with you. Now I'm in a whole new world with you.

Unbelievable sights. Indescribable feeling. Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling through an endless diamond sky.

A whole new world. A hundred thousand things to see. I'm like a shooting star. I've come so far. I can't go back to where I used to be.

Don't you dare close your eyes. Hold your breath it gets better.

A whole new world with new horizons to pursue. I'll chase them anywhere. There's time to spare. Let me share this whole new world with you.

Every turn a surprise. Every moment, red-letter. A whole new world. That's where we'll be.

A whole new world. That's where we'll be. A thrilling chase. A wondrous place. For you and me
