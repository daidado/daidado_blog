There used to be a greying tower alone on the sea. You became the light on the dark side of me. Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill but did you know that when it snows, my eyes become large and the light that you shine can't be seen?

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey. Ooo, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah. Now that your rose is in bloom a light hits the gloom on the grey.There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say. You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain. Baby, to me, you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny. Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?

But did you know that when it snows my eyes become large and the light that you shine can't be seen? Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey. Ooo, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah. Now that your rose is in bloom a light hits the gloom on the grey.

I've been kissed by a rose on the grey. I've been kissed by a rose on the grey. And if I should fall, will it all go away? I've been kissed by a rose on the grey.
