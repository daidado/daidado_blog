Here's a little song I wrote; you might want to sing it note-for-note. Don't worry, be happy. In every life we have some trouble but when you worry, you make it double. Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry, be happy now.

Oh Don't worry. Wooh Be happy. Wooh Don't worry, be happy. Ooh Don't worry. Wooh Be happy. Wooh Don't worry, be happy.

Ain't got no place to lay your head. Somebody came and took your bed. Don't worry, be happy. The landlord say your rent is late. He may have to litigate. Don't worry, ha ha, be happy. Look at me, I'm happy.

Ooh Don't worry. Ooh Be happy. Ooh. Here, I'll give you my phone number. When you're worried, call me. I'll make you happy. Ooh Don't worry, Wooh Be happy. Wooh.

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style, ain't got no gal to make you smile. But don't worry. Be happy. 'Cause when you're worried, your face will frown and that will bring everybody down so don't worry. Be happy. Don't worry, be happy now.

Ooh Don't worry. Ooh Be happy. Wooh Don't worry, be happy. Oooh Don't worry. Wooh Be happy. Wooh Don't worry, be happy.

Now there, is this song I wrote. I hope you learned it note-for-note, like good little children. Don't worry. Be happy. A-listen to a-what I say. In your life, expect some trouble. When you worry you make it double. Don't worry, be happy, be happy now.

Oooh Don't worry. Ooh Be happy. Ooh Don't worry, be happy. Ooh Don't worry. Wooh Be happy. Wooh Don't worry, be happy. Oooh Don't worry, don't worry. Ooh Don't do it, be happy. Ooh Put a smile on your face. Don't bring everybody down like this. Oooh Don't worry it will soon pass, whatever it is.

Oooh Don't worry, be happy. Oooh I'm not worried. Oooh I'm happy. Oooh.
