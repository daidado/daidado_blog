Somewhere out there beneath the pale moonlight someone's thinking of me and loving me tonight. Somewhere out there someone's saying a prayer that we'll find one another in that dream somewhere out there. And even though I know how very far apart we are it helps to think we might be wishin' on the same bright star. And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby it helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky.

Somewhere out there, if love can see us through. Then we'll be together somewhere out there out where dreams come true. And even though I know how very far apart we are it helps to think we might be wishin' on the same bright star. And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby it helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky.

Somewhere out there, if love can see us through. Then we'll be together somewhere out there out where dreams come true
