Tonight we are young so let's set the world on fire. We can burn brighter than the sun.

Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight. My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State. My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar. My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking about a scar, and I know I gave it to you months ago. I know you're trying to forget. But between the drinks and subtle things the holes in my apologies, you know I'm trying hard to take it back.

So if by the time the bar closes and you feel like falling down, I'll carry you home.

Tonight we are young so let's set the world on fire. We can burn brighter than the sun.

Now I know that I'm not all that you got. I guess that I, I just thought, maybe we could find new ways to fall apart. But our friends are back so let's raise a cup. 'Cause I found someone to carry me home.

Tonight we are young so let's set the world on fire. We can burn brighter than the sun.
Tonight we are young so let's set the world on fire. We can burn brighter than the sun.

Carry me home tonight. Just carry me home tonight. Carry me home tonigh. Just carry me home tonight.

The world is on my side. I have no reason to run. So will someone come and carry me home tonight. The end is never right nut I can hear the choir so will someone tell them carry me home.

Tonight we are young so let's set the world on fire. We can burn brighter than the sun.
Tonight we are young so let's set the world on fire. We can burn brighter than the sun.

So if by the time the bar closes and you feel like falling down, I'll carry you home.
