So many nights I'd sit by my window waiting for someone to sing me his song. So many dreams I kept deep inside me. Alone in the dark but now you've come along.

And you light up my life. You give me hope to carry on. You light up my days and fill my nights with song.

Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water. Could it be finally I'm turnin' for home? Finally a chance to say "Hey, I love you." Never again to be all alone.

And you light up my life. You give me hope to carry on. You light up my days and fill my nights with song.

'Cause you, you light up my life. You give me hope to carry on. You light up my days and fill my nights with song.

It can't be wrong when it feels so right. 'Cause youâ€¦..you light up my life

Love soft as an easy chair. Love fresh as the morning air. One love that is shared by two I have found with you. Like a rose under the April snow, I was always certain love would grow. Love ageless and evergreen seldom seen by two. You and I will make each night the first. Every day a beginning. Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed. They warm and excite us 'cause we have the brightest love. Two lights that shine as one Morning glory and midnight sun. Time... we've learned to sail above. Time... won't change the meaning of one love. Ageless and ever evergreen...
