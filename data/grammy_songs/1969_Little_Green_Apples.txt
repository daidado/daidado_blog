And I wake up in the mornin' with my hair down in my eyes and she says "Hi." And I stumble to the breakfast table while the kids are goin' off to school goodbye. And she reaches out 'n' takes my hand and squeezes it 'n' says "How ya feelin hon?" And I look across at smilin' lips that warm my heart and see my mornin' sun.

And if that's not lovin' me then all I've got to say: God didn't make little green apples and it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime. And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme. God didn't make little green apples and it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime.

And when my self is feelin' low I think about her face aglow and ease my mind. Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy and ask her if she could get away and meet me. And maybe we could grab a bite to eat and she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me. And I'm always late but she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 'cause she's made that way.

And if that ain't lovin' me then all I've got to say: God didn't make little green apples and it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes. And there's no such thing as make-believe puppy dogs, autumn leaves 'n' BB guns. God didn't make little green apples and it don't rain in Indianapolis
