Forgive, sounds good. Forget, I’m not sure I could. They say time heals everything but I’m still waiting.

I’m through with doubt. There’s nothing left for me to figure out. I’ve paid a price and I’ll keep paying.

I’m not ready to make nice. I’m not ready to back down. I’m still mad as hell and I don’t have time to go round and round and round. It’s too late to make it right. I probably wouldn’t if I could. ‘Cause I’m mad as hell and can’t bring myself to do what it is you think I should.

I know you said can’t you just get over it. It turned my whole world around and I kind of like it.

I made my bed and I sleep like a baby with no regrets and I don’t mind sayin’ it’s a sad sad story when a mother will teach her daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger. And how in the world can the words that I said send somebody so over the edge that they’d write me a letter
sayin’ that I better shut up and sing or my life will be over?
