From a distance the world looks blue and green and the snow capped mountains white. From a distance the ocean meets the stream and the eagle takes to flight. From a distance there is harmony and it echoes through the land. Its the voice of hope. Its the voice of peace. Its the voice of every man.

From a distance we all have enough and no one is in need. And there are no guns, no bombs and no disease, no hungry mouths to feed. From a Distance we are instruments marching in a common band. Playing songs of hope. playing songs of peace. They are the songs of every man.

God is watching us. God is watching us. God is watching us. From a distance. From a distance.

You look like my friend even though we are at war. From a distance I just cannot comprehend what all this fightings for. From a distance there is harmony and it echoes through the land. And its the hope of hopes. Its the love of loves. Its the heart of every man.

God is watching us. God is watching us. God is watching us. From a distance. God is watching us. God is watching us. God is watching us. From a distance.
