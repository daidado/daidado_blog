Unforgettable, that's what you are. Unforgettable though near or far. Like a song of love that clings to me how the thought of you does things to me. Never before has someone been more.

Unforgettable in every way. And forever more, that's how you'll stay. That's why, darling, it's incredible that someone so unforgettable thinks that I am unforgettable too.
