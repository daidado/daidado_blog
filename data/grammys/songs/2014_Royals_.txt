I've never seen a diamond in the flesh. I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies. And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town, no post code envy. 

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom, bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room. We don't care. We're driving Cadillacs in our dreams. But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece, jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash. We don't care. We aren't caught up in your love affair.

And we'll never be royals; it don't run in our blood. That kind of lux just ain't for us. We crave a different kind of buzz. Let me be your ruler. You can call me Queen B. And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule); let me live that fantasy.

My friends and I we've cracked the code. We count our dollars on the train to the party. And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this; we didn't come from money.

We're bigger than we ever dreamed, and I'm in love with being queen. Life is great without a care. We aren't caught up in your love affair.
