Forgive, sounds good. Forget, Im not sure I could. They say time heals everything but Im still waiting. Im through with doubt. Theres nothing left for me to figure out. Ive paid a price and Ill keep paying.

Im not ready to make nice. Im not ready to back down. Im still mad as hell and I dont have time to go round and round and round. Its too late to make it right. I probably wouldnt if I could. Cause Im mad as hell, cant bring myself to do what it is you think I should.

I know you said cant you just get over it. It turned my whole world around and I kind of like it.

I made my bed and I sleep like a baby with no regrets and I dont mind sayin. Its a sad sad story when a mother will teach her daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger. And how in the world can the words that I said send somebody so over the edge that theyd write me a letter sayin that I better shut up and sing or my life will be over?
