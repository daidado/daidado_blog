There comes a time when we heed a certain call, when the world must come together as one. There are people dying and it's time to lend a hand to life, the greatest gift of all.

We can't go on pretending day by day that someone, somewhere will soon make a change. We all are a part of God's great big family and the truth, you know, love is all we need.

We are the world, we are the children. We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving. There's a choice we're making. We're saving our own lives. It's true we'll make a better day just you and me.

Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares and their lives will be stronger and free. As God has shown us by turning stone to bread so we all must lend a helping hand

We are the world, we are the children. We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving. There's a choice we're making. We're saving our own lives. It's true we'll make a better day just you and me.

When you're down and out, there seems no hope at all. But if you just believe there's no way we can fall. Well, well, well let's realize that a change can only come when we stand together as one.

We are the world, we are the children. We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving. There's a choice we're making. We're saving our own lives. It's true we'll make a better day just you and me.
